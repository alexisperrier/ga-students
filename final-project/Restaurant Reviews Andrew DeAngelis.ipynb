    "### The Problem\n",
    "<strong>Amazon Food Reviews -</strong> Determine the score based on the sentiment of the review<br>\n",
    "<strong>Yelp Reviews -</strong> Determine what type of food each user likes based on review sentiment and star ratings<br>\n",
    "<strong>NY Restaurant Reviews -</strong> Determine what makes a restaurant popular? Location, food, ambiance?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "<strong>Amazon Food Reviews -</strong> Kaggle <br>\n",
    "<strong>Yelp Reviews -</strong> Yelp\n",
    "<strong>NY Restaurant Reviews -</strong> Factual\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "<strong>Amazon Food Review -</strong> Using NLP to develop alogrithms that can predict the sentiment of the user review and placing that into a score. Success will be determined by the accuracy of the predicted score against the actual score. The summary will be used to predict the individual score.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Yelp Reviews -</strong> Using NLP to develop algorithms that can predict the category of restaurant that a user may like. Success wil be determined by testing the predictor model score against the review a user gives a restaurant. The model will predict food categories the user likes and that prediction will be used to see if the user likes a rated restaurant.\n",

    "<strong>NY Restaurant Reviews</strong> Using NLP to develop algorithms that can identify the categories that are predictors of the rating of a restaurant. Success will be determined by testing the model against the restaurant review. The model will determine the  score based on the weighting of the restaurant attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lightning Talk\n",
    "All three ideas will center around customer reviews of food or restaurants. The first idea is to build a model to identify the user score of a food product based on the sentiment of the review. The second idea is to build a model to determine the type of food each user likes based on their previous reviews of similar food categories. The third idea is to build a model to determine the restaurant attributes that make it popular."
